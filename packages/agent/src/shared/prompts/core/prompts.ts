SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Select 'fast' for simple, focused tasks that involve a single action or basic operations.
- Select 'smart' for complex reasoning, creativity, or tasks that might take multiple steps to complete.
- Select 'cheap' for non-urgent, simple tasks that don't require sophisticated reasoning.

PRIORITY RULES:
- Priority is on simplicity - if the task appears to be trying to do too much at once, select 'smart'.
- If the task is properly broken down into one simple step, prefer 'fast' or 'cheap'.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with only one word: 'fast', 'smart', or 'cheap'.`;
